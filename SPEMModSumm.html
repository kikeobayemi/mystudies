									<p>  In the first week of the module, all participants got assigned to project groups; Group 1 and Group 2. In the past, I have had both positive and unexpected negative experiences whilst working in a group but this time, being the third time, i feel better prepared. I have some course mates in my group whom i had previously worked with in other modules so I am familiar with their style of work as well as their strengths. 
										To facilitate communication amongst ourselves, I set up a discord channel and added the rest of the team. I also sent off our team contract to the module tutor
									</p>
									<p> Our first collaborative discussion on “Project Failures” was an insightful one.  We discussed some notable past troublesome projects and learned the reasons why they failed. To summarise, every project failure can be categorised under four major areas; Tasks, people, methods and environment according to Lehtinen et al. (2014).  I believe having this discussion early on in the module is a good way to create awareness amongst course participants and prepare us for the summative group assessments ahead. It also gives an appreciation of what could go wrong in a real-life project team. Ultimately, I am more aware of contributory factors to the success or failure of a project.

									<p> I engaged with other course participants on their posts, raising questions on how to mitigate against common causes of project failures. I got to develop my research and analytical skills by reading extensively and analysing some of the case studies shared. 
									</p>
									<p>
									We had a module seminar this week to discuss behaviour driven development - the use of  Gherkin language to specify how a system should behave. I found this subject very useful for our upcoming team projects and also in a real life project management scenario. The formative tasks helped me to practice how to capture and test requirements using the gherkin language and the python behave engine. I was able to appreciate the importance of eliminating ambiguity when capturing user requirements.
									</p>
									<p>
									Our first team meeting as Group 1 was also held this week to discuss our plans for the team project. It was a productive meeting as everyone attended and made valuable contributions. The meeting yielded some action items to kickstart our project and I also got introduced to a new PM tool, clickup by my team mate Sergio which the entire team seemed ok with for our project management.

									In week 3, my group (Team 1) set up a meeting with group 2 to discuss project requirements. Both teams played the role of Customer and developer and asked questions to clarify requirements on each party’s list. The tutor was also present to observe and provide guidance where necessary. We had a productive session and achieved all that we set out to do. The outcome of the meeting showed the importance of good planning and preparation in project management. My group had requested the requirements prior to the meeting and already had some key questions prepared, making the discussion between both parties a smooth sailing one.
									</p>
									<p>
									The lecturecast titled Software Development life cycle explained phases of software development life cycle and activities conducted by developers at each stage. The section of the lecturecast that covered mistakes made in software engineering is invaluable particularly because we had been discussing the causes of project failure and it was interesting to discover some of the mistakes mentioned by Ghazi et al (1999) (such as  unsystematic or insufficient testing, requirement and quality features not determined, unrealistic deadlines) are still happening today. A typical example is the Ariane 5 disaster which failed due to requirements and testing shortfalls. The lecturecast material and our collaborative discussion has broadened my knowledge on causes of project failures. If I get the opportunity to work as part of  any project management team in future, I am confident that I can make valuable contributions on how to avoid project pitfalls. 
									</p>
									<p>
									For the  formative task, we were required to read the learning material Dicheva & Hodge (2018) and then analyse the data structures of a frequently used online system. This activity opened up opportunities for research and critical thinking as I had never given a thought to data structures implemented by systems I use regularly.

									The second seminar of the module took place this week. For the seminar preparation exercise, I read about a modern product on the IEEE Spectrum website, Prosthetic hand which was designed to provide a sense of touch to the user.
									</p>
									<p>
									I practised using the Volere requirements template to capture a few requirements of the Prosthetic hands. The Volere template helps organisations save a lot of time in requirements gathering and also ensures that requirements are appropriately and adequately captured by including details on requirement rationale, originator, fit criterion, dependencies and supporting documentation (Volere, n.d). I found this task very insightful as I was able to learn important sections to include when capturing user requirements. 
									</p>
									<p>
									For our group assignment, we had a follow up meeting with Group 2 to agree on the requirements to be accepted and those to be rejected. Requirements gathering is known to be one of the most difficult phases of project management as identifying customer’s true needs can be difficult (Larson & Larson, 2015).  I did not get this experience during our meetings with Group 2 as there were no arguments on what requirements to be accepted or detailed discussion on customer’s most desired features in a product. 
									</p>
									<p>
									I think having teams play a dual role of customer and developer created a situation where one team played nice to the other team so the same gesture could be reciprocated. This factor, in my opinion, did not  closely portray a real life project management situation or attract genuine participation from students.

									Managing User perceptions is an important aspect of software development, Our collaborative discussion for this week was on Factors Affecting User Experience. I am not sure why most course participants have not engaged in this discussion but whilst conducting some research for my post, I learnt important factors affecting iUX such as product aesthetics, user emotions and product effectiveness.
									</p>
									<p>
									Prior to this time, I never appreciated the job of a UX designer nor understood the reason websites like Amazon implement many new and improved features on their website all the time. Every element on amazon’s website creates a positive experience for the user for example having a very efficient search feature or using the product page to highlight key benefits, ratings and available delivery options on a product are bound to optimise conversion rates (The manifest, 2019)

									Week 6 was a busy week for the group as we had to submit our first assessment. It turned out that working together with my teammates to finalise our submission wasn’t such an enjoyable experience. I observed three quiet members trying to make last minute contributions to our work. Although the contributions were invaluable, our quality of work would have improved consistently over the weeks if they had come earlier and more frequently. This taught me that every individual has something to offer no matter how inexperienced that person may think he/she is. Also, a project manager should continuously follow up with team mates to get their feedback on a project as this will improve the overall quality of work.
									</p>
									<p>
									The codio exercises on test driven development were very beneficial towards improving my coding skills. Practising the implementation of pylint and pytest gave me a good foundation on how to implement code quality and tests for our week 11 assessment. One of my personal goals in the SEPM module is to gain as much experience as possible with python tools and libraries that can be used in achieving the different stages of a SDLC. So far I have seen how to use the python behave engine for testing user requirements but now I am looking forward to using python to achieve other tasks such as estimation, planning and code testing.

									Our group had a strategy meeting on how to approach the week 11 assignment. My teammates appear to be more motivated and enthusiastic probably because of the low grades we achieved in the first summative assessment and the need to do better in the second one . I observed  increased participation in our discussions and  in depth research compared to the first assignment and as such I am looking forward to a better group performance this time. 
									</p>
									<p>
									We split the teams into two smaller groups; one group focusing on code development and the other group, developing the presentation file. I consider presentation skills one of my great strengths so I decided to join the presentation team but I asked to also be involved in testing. Our group will most likely be using Github Actions to automate the required tests and I am quite keen on learning more about the software development features of github. 
									</p>
									<p>
									This week’s Lecturecast titled “Estimating, Planning and Risk” taught various Risk Management frameworks, estimation methods and planning tools. After studying the various estimation methods, we decided to go with the expert judgement method because it is based on use cases and can be done earlier in the SDLC to give developers good room for adequate planning (Lecturecast, 2021). However, more accurate results have been achieved using a hybrid approach so the tutor advised combining expert judgement with planning poker for our summative assessment. I agree with incorporating planning poker as this estimation method allows all team members to be involved in the project estimation and be aware of resources and time involved in completing the project.

									As part of the seminar 4 preparation exercise, I wrote a python code for the Expert Judgement estimation method and it worked really well. This task has helped to improve my coding skills and also my familiarity with the jupyter notebook tool. As an aspiring data scientist, I consider this a very valuable assignment because Jupyter notebook is one of the many tools used by Data Scientists on a daily basis.
									</p>
									<p>
									This week, I tried conducting some research to learn practical ways of applying any of the risk management frameworks taught in the last lecturecast (OCTAVE, openFAIR and NIST) but I had difficulties finding tools to achieve this. We had to use a common risk assessment matrix for our risk analysis.
									</p>
									<p>
									We also decided to go with the Program Evaluation Review Technique (P.E.R.T) estimation method instead of Expert Judgement as the former seemed better suited for our work. Rather than using a fixed time for each task, the Program Evaluation & Review Technique uses three-time estimates, taking into consideration some measure of uncertainty that might be associated with the actual completion of a task (Douglas, 1978). PERT will be used in combination with planning poker.

									The week 9 lecturecast titled Quality Management Strategy helped me to learn some useful code quality strategies. I enjoyed the formative task for this week which required participants to read the material <b>“Mertz, J. (2019) Writing Clean and Pythonic Code. Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology.Mertz, J. (2019) Writing Clean and Pythonic Code. Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology” </b> and apply the concepts to any previously written code. This document helped my group to learn quality improvement strategies such as good code structure and proper code styling which we applied to our group project.

									This week was a practice on using linters to achieve code quality. The codio exercise provided a good way to practice the use of various linters (namely pylint, pydocstyle, pycodestyle and pyflakes) and to discover their use whether logical or stylistic. I even integrated pylint into my pycharm IDE and tested it on one of my previously written codes.

									In week 11, we completed our second summative assessment. Still, not every member of the group participated as I would have loved them to.
									However, I am glad we were able to complete the assessments and submit them in due time. I think overall, if i could choose, I’d rather work on my assessments as an individual and collaborate with other teammates in a forum.
