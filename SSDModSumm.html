									<p> In the introductory week, I was drafted into Team 3 for the module projects which will be submitted in Week 6 and 11 respectively. 
									My team mates and I created a team contract for the group and sent it to the tutor. I find the idea of working in a group quite interesting
									especially because my team mates have a wide range of skills and everyone communicates effectively so far. </p>
									<p>For the week 1 activity, I created a collaborative discussion post and flowchart on the OWASP Top 10 coding weaknesses. 
									I have no prior knowledge of this topic however I was happy to learn about the security challenges of web applications 
									and to increase awareness on how to create more secure software which is basically the focus of the OWASP organisation. 
									I am really looking forward to developing skills on how to create secure solutions throughout this module.

									<p> I got a feedback on my week 1 post from the tutor suggesting the need to elaborate on my flowchart. I was also
									    required to comment on my colleagues’ posts which I did but I had to make further research on vulnerabilities 
									   within a system that could lead to Denial of Service or other forms of attack. It was a fruitful week in terms of research. 
									   I gained a great deal of knowledge of system vulnerabilities and threats. </p>
									<p>
									This week I created a blog post on cybersecurity and human risk. It was insightful to read statistics on incidents caused
									by human vulnerabilities and to learn ways of managing human risk. In the course of my research, I stumbled on a line 
									from the article <b>Conteh, N.Y. & Schmick, P.J. (2021) Cybersecurity Risks, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures to Prevent 
									Social Engineering Attacks. In Ethical Hacking Techniques and Countermeasures for Cybercrime Prevention 19-31. IGI Global.</b> 
									“Regardless of how technologically secure a network seems the human element will always be a vulnerability.” (Conteh & Schmick , 2021). 
									This line left a lasting impression because it emphasizes the importance of managing user risk in organisations.</p>
									<p>
									To conclude the week’s activities, I did some research on secure software development with scrum. I found this activity quite 
									informative as it gave insights on scrum methodology from a security perspective. It emphasizes  the need to implement security right from start.</p>

									<p>My teammates and I had a team activity in which we read the book <b> Pillai, A.B. (2017) Software Architecture with Python. 
									   Birmingham, UK. Packt Publishing Ltd. </b> and discussed about Python programming language, its vulnerabilities and best 
									   practices for programmers. Afterwards, we discussed strategies for implementing our Unit 6 and 11 projects. It was in 
									   this meeting that we concluded on the domain to work on; The large Hadron Collider. According to the Guinness book of 
									   records, the Large Hadron Collider is the largest equipment in the world. This discovery sparked my interest and was 
									   my primary reason for choosing this domain. Other areas sounded a bit common and less interesting to me. </p>
									<p>There was a Codio task on “Exploring Python Tools and Features” which I found very beneficial. Learning how to use 
									   resources like Pylint gave an appreciation of the dangers of poor program styling. I am definitely intrigued by all 
									   the various aspects of secure coding. Prior to now, I was happy to get my code to work as intended but there is a lot 
									   to imbibe going forward. To round off the week’s activity, I created a summary post on the OWASP vulnerability taking 
									   my tutor and teammates’ feedback into consideration. </p>

									<p>We had two programming exercises this week: Recursion and Regex. The key learning points here for me with relation to secure coding are; </p>
									<p>Recursion: to understand how to execute recursive functions securely. Recursion can be prone to overflow errors when not properly written (Fischer, 2014)  </p> 
									<p>Regex: to learn how to create strict patterns (such as passwords) and also to know the characters (or combination of characters) that can subject your code
									  to a ReDoS attack. I found the tutorial in <b> Jaiswal, S. (2020) Python Regular Expression Tutorial </b> very helpful and I was able to write my regex for the UK 
									  postcodes whilst making sure to avoid evil regex patterns as shown in <b> Weidman A. (n.d) Regular Expression – Denial of Service. </b> I also discovered efficiency
									  can be brought into writing regular expressions; on comparing my regex with that of my team mates, I discovered my regex was shorter in length and it still worked fine. </p> 
									<p>On the summative assessment, I shared an outline containing all the relevant sections for the proposal with my team mates and encouraged everyone to start posting a 
									   rough draft of the sections assigned so others could review. This gave us a clear direction and spurred everyone including myself to action. </p>

									<p>This week we discussed Introduction to testing and I began to get a better appreciation of testing

									   code works; I thought as long as a code does its job, then it is complete.</p>
									<p>On the formative activities, I did not really grasp the concept of Equivalence testing with respect 
									   to testing either the functionality, usability, performance or security of a code but I enjoyed working 
									   on the task Exploring the relevance of cyclomatic complexity today. It is worth noting that a program with
									   high complexity value has a high probability for errors (Hamilton, 2021)</p> 
									<p>For the summative assessment, I started my research on the large hadron collider and some of the security 
									   challenges of research institutions such as CERN. Other team mates focused on tools and implementation of 
									   the API. Basically, we all played to our strengths and took on tasks that we felt confident delivering.</p>
