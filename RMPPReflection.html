							My main goal going into the Research Methodology and Professionals Practice (RMPP) Module was to learn how to effectively conduct an academic research, 
							knowing that this will equip me with the right skills needed to succeed in the upcoming M.Sc. capstone project. 
							Below is a reflection of my experience covering the major aspects of the course.
							</p>
              						<p>
							Starting with the first summative assessment of the module, we were required to choose a topic from a list and conduct an extensive literature review on it. 
							I choose the topic Sentiment Analysis because it is a fairly recent and fast-growing research area and I was curious to learn more about it.
							Guiding questions were provided to aid students in drafting their literature review and this turned out to be helpful for me particularly in structuring my thoughts. 
							It is also worth noting that the literature review assessment vastly improved my writing skills. Reflecting back to my previous submissions in the M.Sc. program, 
							I can see the positive changes and I would agree that reviewing a handful of quality academic literature was a major contributory factor to that change. 
							However, writing a good literature review comes with its own challenges.
             						</p>
              						<p>
							Chen et al. (2016) notes that beginning researchers face challenges in selecting relevant literature and lack competency in extracting the key ideas from them.
							The author further mentioned other challenges such as developing themes for discussion and forming a discourse throughout the review. 
							I experienced these difficulties first hand whilst putting together my paper and it served as an eye opener on the level of preparatory work required before 
							choosing a research area. Though I succeeded in completing the assessment, I understand clearly now that it is not enough to select a topic because it appears 
							interesting to the researcher. I would have to critically analyse my capstone project topic with respect to the afore-mentioned challenges before making a final decision.
               						</p>
              						<p>
							Moving on, we began discussing research methods in Unit 3 and explored qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods but then I did not fully internalise the learnings 
							until we did the statistical analysis in Units 8 & 9. This was my favourite aspect of the RMPP module. The Unit 8 exercises on hypothesis testing and summary measures
							provided the necessary exposure on how to effectively conduct data analysis and results interpretation. The Unit 9 exercises on charts worksheets and analysis provided
							guidance on how to draw valuable insights from charts and graphs. Allen et al. (2016) notes that students find it challenging to work through qualitative research methods
							and to pick the right statistical tests needed to answer research questions however I believe the formative activities provided a good starting point towards surmounting 
							this difficulty. More so, the constraints of learning practical tasks online were not felt as the instructions provided were clear, succinct and easy to follow through.
							</p>
							<p>      
							Furthermore, the statistical activities show a practical example of the depth of analysis required for our upcoming M.Sc. capstone project but beyond that, 
							they gave me a deep appreciation of the efforts that researchers put into their work.  Most importantly, these activities have contributed immensely to my career
							as an aspiring data scientist. The foundational knowledge provided in the lecturecast on Summary Measures and Statistical Inference improved my understanding of 
							statistics and how to gain meaningful insights from data. It also developed my research and critical thinking skills as it helped to seek out valuable resources 
							such as https://stathand.net/, a tool which helps to build students statistical decision making abilities (stathand, n.d) . 
							Additionally, I have gathered some useful resources on introductory statistics in a bid to close out identified knowledge gaps and I plan to achieve this before 
							embarking on my final dissertation.
							</p>
              						<p>
							For the second summative assessment, participants were required to submit a Research proposal on a topic of interest. Here, I focused on the data visualisation 
							aspect of sentiment analysis because I discovered that many literature reviews had not delved into that area in details. I enjoyed working on this assessment and 
							I found it less challenging than the first one. This is probably owing to the fact that presentation is one of my key strengths and I was thrilled at the opportunity
							to showcase this. 
               						</p>
              						<p>
							 At some points in the RMPP module, course participants were given the opportunity to engage in collaborative discussions. The topics were centred on ethical computing
							 and research ethics and we were required to write individual posts as well as respond to some other post on the discussion forum. Researching these topics and reading
							 the contributions of others helped to increase my awareness on applicable codes of conduct within the industry. Before the end of the second quarter 2022, I will be
							 signing up to the British Computing Society where I can learn more on the ethics of the computing profession. Continuous Improvement on ethical virtues such as
							resoluteness, courage, humility, fairness, respectfulness and more (Resnik, 2012) is now at the top of my personal development list.
             						</p>
            						<p> 
							One other practice I hope to adopt (and share with young computing graduates within my sphere) going forward is to conduct some due diligence on an organisation’s 
							ethical standards before joining their workforce. As noted by Al Habusi et al. (2016), employees’ behaviour in an organisation is positively influenced by the 
							leadership’s ethical conduct. I believe computing professionals would agree that a good ethical environment is not only necessary for individual growth but 
							also beneficial to the computing industry at large. Considering the fact that I am looking to switch careers and possibly organisations, such awareness could 
							not have come at a better time than this. I am immensely grateful for this opportunity. 
							</p>
							<p>
							Overall, the RMPP module has satisfied all the learning outcomes as well as my personal expectations. It has equally provided a remarkable learning journey with many
							valuable lessons to latch on for the successful completion of my master’s program as well as the future.  Nevertheless, I wish I had utilised more of the feedback
							opportunities provided by the tutor. It has been proven that feedback improves student learning when it gives guidance on areas of strengths and improvement (Black & William, 1998). 
							I believe regular engagements with the module tutor would have helped me achieve higher grades in the summative assessments but in all, I am happy with how the module
							turned out particularly with the action items that it has produced.
