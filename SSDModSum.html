									<h3><u>Reflection</u></h3>
									<p> In the introductory week, I was drafted into Team 3 for the module projects which will be submitted in Week 6 and 11 respectively. 
									My team mates and I created a team contract for the group and sent it to the tutor. I find the idea of working in a group quite interesting
									especially because my team mates have a wide range of skills and everyone communicates effectively so far. </p>
									<p>For the week 1 activity, I created a collaborative discussion post and flowchart on the OWASP Top 10 coding weaknesses. 
									I have no prior knowledge of this topic however I was happy to learn about the security challenges of web applications 
									and to increase awareness on how to create more secure software which is basically the focus of the OWASP organisation. 
									I am really looking forward to developing skills on how to create secure solutions throughout this module.

									<p> I got a feedback on my week 1 post from the tutor suggesting the need to elaborate on my flowchart. I was also
									    required to comment on my colleagues’ posts which I did but I had to make further research on vulnerabilities 
									   within a system that could lead to Denial of Service or other forms of attack. It was a fruitful week in terms of research. 
									   I gained a great deal of knowledge of system vulnerabilities and threats. </p>
									<p>
									This week I created a blog post on cybersecurity and human risk. It was insightful to read statistics on incidents caused
									by human vulnerabilities and to learn ways of managing human risk. In the course of my research, I stumbled on a line 
									from the article <b>Conteh, N.Y. & Schmick, P.J. (2021) Cybersecurity Risks, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures to Prevent 
									Social Engineering Attacks. In Ethical Hacking Techniques and Countermeasures for Cybercrime Prevention 19-31. IGI Global.</b> 
									“Regardless of how technologically secure a network seems the human element will always be a vulnerability.” (Conteh & Schmick , 2021). 
									This line left a lasting impression because it emphasizes the importance of managing user risk in organisations.</p>
									<p>
									To conclude the week’s activities, I did some research on secure software development with scrum. I found this activity quite 
									informative as it gave insights on scrum methodology from a security perspective. It emphasizes  the need to implement security right from start.</p>

									<p>My teammates and I had a team activity in which we read the book <b> Pillai, A.B. (2017) Software Architecture with Python. 
									   Birmingham, UK. Packt Publishing Ltd. </b> and discussed about Python programming language, its vulnerabilities and best 
									   practices for programmers. Afterwards, we discussed strategies for implementing our Unit 6 and 11 projects. It was in 
									   this meeting that we concluded on the domain to work on; The large Hadron Collider. According to the Guinness book of 
									   records, the Large Hadron Collider is the largest equipment in the world. This discovery sparked my interest and was 
									   my primary reason for choosing this domain. Other areas sounded a bit common and less interesting to me. </p>
									<p>There was a Codio task on “Exploring Python Tools and Features” which I found very beneficial. Learning how to use 
									   resources like Pylint gave an appreciation of the dangers of poor program styling. I am definitely intrigued by all 
									   the various aspects of secure coding. Prior to now, I was happy to get my code to work as intended but there is a lot 
									   to imbibe going forward. To round off the week’s activity, I created a summary post on the OWASP vulnerability taking 
									   my tutor and teammates’ feedback into consideration. </p>

									<p>We had two programming exercises this week: Recursion and Regex. The key learning points here for me with relation to secure coding are; </p>
									<p>Recursion: to understand how to execute recursive functions securely. Recursion can be prone to overflow errors when not properly written (Fischer, 2014)  </p> 
									<p>Regex: to learn how to create strict patterns (such as passwords) and also to know the characters (or combination of characters) that can subject your code
									  to a ReDoS attack. I found the tutorial in <b> Jaiswal, S. (2020) Python Regular Expression Tutorial </b> very helpful and I was able to write my regex for the UK 
									  postcodes whilst making sure to avoid evil regex patterns as shown in <b> Weidman A. (n.d) Regular Expression – Denial of Service. </b> I also discovered efficiency
									  can be brought into writing regular expressions; on comparing my regex with that of my team mates, I discovered my regex was shorter in length and it still worked fine. </p> 
									<p>On the summative assessment, I shared an outline containing all the relevant sections for the proposal with my team mates and encouraged everyone to start posting a 
									   rough draft of the sections assigned so others could review. This gave us a clear direction and spurred everyone including myself to action. </p>

									<p>This week we discussed Introduction to testing and I began to get a better appreciation of testing 
									   other aspects of a code besides functionality. Before this module, I only focused on testing if the 
									   code works; I thought as long as a code does its job, then it is complete.</p>
									<p>On the formative activities, I did not really grasp the concept of Equivalence testing with respect 
									   to testing either the functionality, usability, performance or security of a code but I enjoyed working 
										on the task <b> Exploring the relevance of cyclomatic complexity today.</b> It is worth noting that a program with
									   high complexity value has a high probability for errors (Hamilton, 2021)</p> 
									<p>For the summative assessment, I started my research on the large hadron collider and some of the security 
									   challenges of research institutions such as CERN. Other team mates focused on tools and implementation of 
									   the API. Basically, we all played to our strengths and took on tasks that we felt confident delivering.</p>

									<p>This week, my team mates and I had to complete the design proposal which we had been working on since week 3. 
									I developed the introduction and challenges section. I also designed the use case for our project and outlined the
									ethical considerations. There were a few conflicting opinions on sections to include and document styling (font size, spacing)
									but in the end, we found a common ground and completed the job.</p>
									<p>The codio activity this week was on <b>Testing with Python.</b> Exploring python with linters showed how to test if a written
									code meets recommended styling. I practiced testing with <b>pylint</b> and <b>flake8</b>. Flake8 did not seem to focus on as much detail 
									as pylint; I discovered certain aspects of code styling such as file name, variable case, missing docstrings weren’t a concern
									with flake8. For this reason, I would most likely use pylint for my code styling going forward. </p> 
									<p>Testing a code’s complexity was another interesting part of this week’s activity particularly because until week 5 when we 
									studied cyclomatic complexity, I did not know this was an important factor to consider when writing a code. I practiced with 
									mccabe tool on codio and got first-hand experience of testing code complexity.</p>

									<p>The topic this week was on Distributed Computing to Microservices. I did some research as usual to get an understanding of how

										note of here is that both technologies are  in use, both have their pros and cons and the decision ultimately lies with the organisation. </p>
									<p>We made a demonstration of our group project in the seminar this week. The group plan was to demonstrate our progress on the task but I took
									   the initiative to create some presentation slides explaining the goal of the entire project and why certain decisions were taken. I am happy
									   that this was well received by my teammates and the tutor.</p>
									<p>I did not enjoy the formative task on, “Ontology”. I could not work out how to apply it in our group project but I really appreciate the idea
									   of using common terms to explain concepts in a way that every stakeholder understands. Ontology facilitates communication and ultimately improves
									   code quality (Gonzalez-Perez & Henderson-Sellers, 2006).</p>

									<h3><u>Reflection</u></h3>
									<p> We had an interesting discussion this week on the Torvalds-Tanenbaum debate in which I learnt about monolithic
									   and microkernel operating systems (OS). I also read extensively about the history of Linux as a monolithic OS, 
									   its usage across all kinds of computers and security issues with respect to its huge code base. I came across an 
									   exciting term “bug density” in my research which relates to the amount of bugs per line of code.</p>
									<p> From a security point of view, microkernels appear to be safer because they have fewer lines of executable kernel 
									   code (Bissyande, 2013). However, reports show that monoliths have a huge level of dominance in the market (Computerworld, 2008; Statista, 2021).
									   The question on my mind then is “Are operating systems developers not giving a higher priority to Security?” I spent more time conducting research 
									   on this topic than any other  in the module. As we speak, I am still looking for conclusive answers to my question.
									</p>
									<p>As for our group project, we completed all the outstanding functionalities in the API. I did some functionality testing and developed some 
									   parts of the documentation. In comparison to the proposal we submitted in week 6, we did not implement the privileges as designed. It was a
									   bit challenging and there wasn’t much time left. In the end, we created just two types of privileges as opposed to three which was originally 
									   planned. I think we underestimated the time involved in carrying out this project coupled with the fact that all three of us were taking double
									   modules. Next time, I would start preparing early to avoid rushing and leaving out some bits on an assignment. </p>

							<p>
							This is the final week of the Secure Software Development  module . We had our last seminar where we discussed the Torvalds-Tanenbaum Debate from the previous week.  
							We were also required to complete our ePortfolio and submit for assessment.  I feel  thankful for my tutor and my teammates as they are the best people I have worked 
							with in an academic setting. Overall, I am happy with this module. It satisfied every learning outcome as well as my personal goals for self-development.
							I am moving on to other courses with an improved knowledge base and  higher level of confidence as a computer scientist.
