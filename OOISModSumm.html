						 <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
						 <li>Understand the core elements of an information system.</li>
						 <li>Appreciate the common issues that can arise when deploying a system.</li>
						 <li>Gain an understanding of the SDLC, its phases and their importance.</li>
						 
						 <h3>Summary/Reflection</h3>
	    
            					  <p>The first Lecturecast of the module  gave me an introductory knowledge on Information Systems (IS).
                				     The key learnings from the lecturecast can be summarized into the points below: <p>
						 <li>An information system consists of 5 major components namely: The hardware, the software, data, processes, and people. </li>
						 <li>A poorly implemented information system could have severe consequences on an organization, its customers, and the 
						     society therefore it is important to take the right approach to build one.</li>
						 <li>An information system is typically developed using the SDLC methodology.</li>
						 <li>The stages in SDLC – Systems Development Life Cycle are:
						     Planning, Analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance. 
						 </li>
						 <li>Waterfall and Agile are examples of development methodologies.</li>
						
						 
						 <p><u><b>Activity</b></u><br>
						    As part of Week 1 activities, I shared an example of IS failure: <b>Irish Elections, June 2004</b>. In my post, I discussed the 
						    causes of this failure as well as the impact on the Irish Citizens, the Irish Government and the IS solution provider. </p>

						 <li>Understand the core components of an information system and their importance.</li>
						 <li>Evaluate a range of issues and appropriate solutions or mitigations.</li>
						
						<p></p> 
						  <u><b>Summary/Reflection</b></u>
            				<p> The first seminar of the module took place this week: <b>En Route Automation Machine (ERAM)</b>
               				    where we analyzed another example of IS failure as explained in this article:  
                			    Scott, A. & Menn, J. (2014) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airtraffic-bug-exclusive/exclusive-air-traffic-system-failure-caused-by-computer-memory-shortage-idUSBREA4B02320140512" target = "_blank">Exclusive: Air traffic system failure caused by computer memory shortage</a> Reuters. 
           				 
					   Also in this week, i read a lot of other IS failure cases shared by my colleagues and from the unit 1 additional reading resource 
					    <a href ="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3412197/top-software-failures-in-recent-history.html" target="_blank">"Computer World (2020) Top Software Failures in Recent History"</a>
					    It was insightful to learn how things could go wrong at all stages of software development including planning, requirements analysis,
					    and systems design. As seen from these cases, the cost associated with an IS failure is very huge and as such system owners and developers 
					    need to be more thorough at every stage in a SDLC.</p>

              					<h2>Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Design</h2>
							  <u><b>Learning Outcomes</b></u>
							 <li>Identify the appropriate objects within a system.</li>
							 <li>Develop an object-oriented design for a system.</li>
							 <li>Correctly apply composition and inheritance where appropriate.</li>
							 <p></p>
							  <u><b>Summary/Reflection</b></u>
              					<p>Object-oriented design involves implementing a software in terms of objects and a set of methods that define meaningful
						    operations on the objects (Olagunju & Akpan, 2015). Object-oriented techniques are widely used in developing information systems 
						    and in the computing field at large (Paetau, 1997).</p>
						 <p> The second lecturecast of the module titled “Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Design (OOD)” provided some key insights into
						    the topic. The main points are summarized below:
						<li>An Object is a data structure with 2 main components: data (attributes) and procedures (methods or functions)</li>
						
						<li>Four(4) fundamental concepts used in OOD:
						<b>Abstraction</b> which involves hiding inbuilt properties of our object and only showing what the user needs.
						<b>Encapsulation</b>:the processing of bundling data and methods together.
						<b>Inheritance</b> which allows an object to use attributes and functions from another object and
						<b>Polymorphism</b> which allows an object to take multiple forms
							 </li>	</p>
						
						<li><u>Advantages of OOD:
						It helps to model real world effectively.It supports system flexibility and reusability.</li>
						 
						<li><u>Relationships in OOD</u></li>
						<p style="margin-left: 40px">Association: is a relationship between two objects without any particular relationship. It depicts the ‘has a’ relationship.
						<br>Composition: A parent and child relationship whereby the child cannot exist without the parent. For example, when a bag is destroyed, 
						all the internal pockets are destroyed. Composition depicts the ‘owns a’ relationship.<br>
						Aggregation: A parent and child relationship whereby the child can still exist without the parent. For example, wheels can 
						still exist outside of a car. Aggregation depicts the ‘uses a’ relationship</p>
	
							
							 <p><b><u>Activity</u></b><br>	 
              					   The practical activity this week was to create an object-oriented design of a supermarket. I learnt how to draw class <br>
                				   diagrams and object diagrams with the aid of the module ebook and additional online resources. This activity was <br>
                				   quite engaging as it required a lot of thinking particularly on the relationships between the various classes in the<br>
						   supermarket model. I did some research on the best drawing tools and finally settled down to using “Lucidchart” to create<br> 
						   my design.</p>
                				 
             					 <p>Finally, to round off week 3 activities, i created a summary post of all the activities of the last three weeks. This includes the discussions
					            on IS failures and the key concepts of Object-Oriented Design. </p>

						 <h2>Object-Oriented Development and Python</h2>
						  <u><b>Learning Outcomes</b></u>
						<li> Explore object-oriented principles and concepts in Python.</li>
						 <li> Investigate inheritance, composition and polymorphism in Python.</li>
						 <li>Discuss the key challenges involved in developing using an object-oriented approach.</li>
						 <u><b>Summary/Reflection</b></u>
						 <p>This week I learnt how to code classes and objects in python by following the codio activities and the supplemental courses<br> 
						    on youtube. I had some difficulties at first understanding how to create instances of classes and to copy class attributes <br>
						    but with the youtube links provided on codio and notes from <a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/ch07.html" target = "_blank">Elkner, J. (2020) Beginning Python Programming for Aspiring Web Developers</a>, I was
						    able to grasp the idea better. </p>
						 <p><b>Pros</b><br>
						
						    I had a great time solving the codio challenges, particularly seeing how the use of classes and objects can help reuse code
						    thereby avoiding time-wasting repetitions. More importantly, the UML diagrams (relationships) we had learnt last week became clearer as I went through the 
						    “Inheritance” topic on codio.

						 </p>
						 <p><b>Cons</b><br>
						   Python programming is new to me and the idea of importing user-defined functions as seen in some of the codio exercises <br>
						   still seems a bit unclear however I look forward to building my competence as the unit progresses.</p>
						
						 <p>Seminar 2 titled python programming took place this week and the presentation examples helped solidify all that I had already learnt.</p>

						 <h2>Understanding UML</h2>
					 <p>I started learning about UML diagrams during our practical activity in week 3 where I modelled an information system – Online Supermarket.
					 This made the week 5 lecturecast: <b>Understanding UML </b> very easy to follow. The main points are summarized below:
					 <li>UML diagrams are a standardized way of communicating information system designs. </li>
					 <li>Use case diagrams  are mainly used for capturing requirements, planning iteration of development and validating a system.</li>
					 <li>Class diagrams are the most commonly used UML diagrams. They are used to model objects and the relationships between them. 
					     They also show data (attributes) and functions that are performed on them.</li><br>
					 <b>Note:</b> the focus for this week is class diagrams</p>
					
					<p><u><b>Practical Activity</b></u><br>
					Our practical activity is to create a class diagram for the supermarket model we had worked on in week 3. I created a more 
					   elaborate version of my week 3 diagram showing the class attributes and functions. This exercise helped me understand class
					   relationships better and how to define multiplicity. At this point, I did not focus much on defining the privacy of the 
						attributes and functions as it still seems a bit grey to me and requires more thoughts.</p>

					<h2>Hands-On with UML</h2>
					<p>This week, I continued with the week 5 lecturecast: <b>Understanding UML </b> but this time with focus on other types of UML diagrams.
					UML diagrams are divided into 2 broad categories: Structure Diagram and Behavioural Diagrams. Object and Class diagrams covered in previous
					weeks fall under the structure category</p>
					
					<p><b>Some behavioural diagrams covered are:</b>
					<li>Sequence diagram: is an  behavioural diagram that describes how objects interact with each other and in what order (lucidchart, 2021)</li>
					<li>Activity diagram: is a behavioural diagram that describes the workflow in the system being modelled (creately, 2021)</li>
					<li>State diagram: is also a behavioural diagram that describes behaviour of objects according to the state that they are in.(creately, 2021)</li>
					</p>
					<p><u><b>Practicals</b></u><br>
					Our Practical activity for this week is to draw a class, sequence and activity diagram for a clinic appointment management system. 
					With this activity, I learnt how to draw sequence and state diagrams for a system. I also discovered that they appear to be easier
					    to create when drawing from an existing class diagram</p>

					 <h2>Database Design</h2>
					 <p>“Data is the new oil” – Clive Humbly, 2006 
					 In this week’s lecturecast, we looked at relational databases and SQL, the technology that underpins them with a focus on normalization</p>
					 </p>
					<p>	
					<u><b>Database</b></u><br>
					Database is a structured approach to data storage. It is made up of 2 key ingredients: (i) The data itself & (ii) Data dictionary. It consists of 3 components:
					<li>Entities: they represent objects</li>
					<li>Attributes: the elements that make up the entity</li>
					<li>Relationships: how two entities might be joined together (for example composition, inheritance) </li>
					<u>Relational databases </u><br>
					A table with rows (also referred to as tuples) and columns (fields or attributes) is known as a relation. </p>
					<p></p>
					<u><b>Normalisation </b></u><br>
					Normalisation aims to prevent data anomalies such as insertion, deletion, and modification anomaly. Normalisation involves taking a table from 1st Normal Form
					to Second Normal Form and then to Third Normal Form. Keys are used to achieve normalisation and maintain the core elements of relational database.
					<li>Primary Key: is unique for each record</li>
					<li>Composite key: using two fields to create our unique identifier:  e.g street name and postcode columns</li>
					<li>Foreign key references another column in another table. e.g column in Property Issues table will make reference to the exact property in Properties table.</li>

					 <h2>Hands-on with Database Design</h2>
					 <p> I learnt about ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) this week.</p>	 
	
					 <p>I did some more reading on normalisation and practiced how to draw ERD Diagrams using lucidchart</p>
						 
					 <p>Most interesting part of the week was researching on Not-Only-SQL (NoSQL) Databases and creating a discussion post.
						 I also came across NewSQL databases in the course of my research. A good number of my colleagues seemed familiar with Redis
						 from their post and this also sparked my interest in it. I have been reading more about Redis since then.</p>

					 <p>The lecture cast covered SQL commands for creating table, updating, deleting table, ordering query results and performing aggregate functions</p> 
					 <p> Our discussion on NoSQL databases continued. Prior to this time, i had little to no knowledge of NoSQL so it was beneficial to read some 
						 insightful posts from my classmates about various kinds of NoSQL databases.</p>
