							The last ten weeks have been a positive learning experience for me. From the discussion topics to the formative tasks, the module seminars, and 
              graded assessments, the OOIS module has been nothing short of rewarding. I had concerns at first coming into this module, of course from the topic, 
              it was evident that programming skills would be required, but here I am, someone whose programming abilities stopped at displaying “Hello World!”. 
              I did not even possess the skills to change the text to my favorite font “comic sans” and it didn’t help much reading the profile of other students 
              as they appeared to be better suited for the course than I was. However, the feeling I have now as I sit back to write this reflection, is that of 
                someone who has almost completed a hurdle before realising that it had begun. </p>
              <p>
              To start with, the collaborative discussion topics were enthralling particularly that of the Information Systems failure. It sparked a lot of 
                engagements (and emotions) from all participants and even though I come from a non-IT field, being part of that discussion was relatable. 
                We all use IS in our daily lives so I was able to settle in nicely. Furthermore, discussing about emerging technologies in database and other IT
                related fields is beneficial for an individual who is aspiring to become an IT professional (that’s also me). Our engagements on the forum 
                significantly helped to develop my research, communication, and analytical skills by creating an opportunity for me to write about topics that I 
                have little knowledge of and critically analyze posts from other participants.</p>
              <p>
              The OOIS module had a good number of formative tasks which sharpened my cognitive skills. A study by Winter, D., D. McClelland, and A. Stewart (1981)
                cited in Terenzeni et al. (1995) reveals that any course that involves integration of ideas across other disciplines has a huge impact in developing 
                students critical thinking. I experienced this firsthand when we had to design an information system in the areas of commerce (online shopping system) 
                and health (for the clinic appointment system). Working out the objects, relationships, privacy of attributes and methods that make up the system spurred
                a lot of research and critical brain-storming sessions. What left a lasting impression, was seeing how the approach of other participants differed from 
                mine and still made a lot of sense. </p>
              <p>The lecture casts were succinct covering keys aspects concerning this module. I found myself looking forward to that of future weeks but somehow, 
                I did not read a lot of the recommended additional study materials. I am still trying to figure out if this was because the lecture casts met my expectations
                or because I am more of a visual learner who prefers watching learning videos. The graded assessments which involved designing an information system and 
                implementing with python programming language have helped to improve my resilience towards tackling challenging projects. Again, coming from a non-programming
                background, it seemed insurmountable building an IS from scratch but being able to achieve it (albeit not in full) has given me the strength I believe will
                get me through the rest of the M.Sc. Computer Science program. I could not be happier that this module was delivered early in the program. Most importantly
                , these assessments have helped me to develop my programming skills within a short time frame and my overall approach to problem-solving. </p>
              <p>
              This module has not helped much in improving my time management skills. Some weeks in the module had tasks that required very little time commitment while 
                other weeks had tasks that required huge time commitment. Consequently, the gap in time distribution across weeks impacted on my ability to deliver the 
                system implementation assignment to my desired standard of quality. It made me underestimate the time involved in completing the task. Nevertheless, I am
                thankful for this situation as it helped me to develop a better planning approach to course works. In subsequent modules, I will look ahead into future 
                activities and identify areas where I can start early preparations. </p>
               <p>
             I would also love to better utilise feedback opportunities by participating more in two-way conversations with the module tutor especially on formative tasks.
            Nicol (2011) states that:
            “If students are to learn from feedback, they must also have opportunities to construct their own meaning from the transmitted information: they must do something
             with it, analyse the message, ask questions about it, discuss it with others and connect it with prior knowledge.” </p>
            <p>In retrospect, the last ten weeks have given me the most fruitful developmental experience I’ve had since corona virus surfaced and disrupted a lot of my plans.
              I came into the OOIS module with hesitations but I picked up some much needed self-assurance to forge ahead in my M.Sc program and life itself.</p>
