							How does managing software development projects differ from managing projects in other fields? I pondered. I have never worked in a Project Management (PM) role but I acquired a Prince 2 PM foundation certificate a few years ago so I am familiar with general project management concepts such as estimation, planning and risk assessment. However, I was curious to learn the specifics of managing software development projects. 
							</p>
              						<p>
							I thought it was a good strategy to start the module with a discussion on causes of project failure. Analysing notable case studies like the IBM 360 sparked my interest and helped me to focus on the detrimental effects of poor project management. 
							I believe having this discussion early on in the module was a good way to create awareness on what could possibly go wrong during our team projects.  Looking back at my experience as a team member and remembering Lehtinen et al. (2014) four main causes of project failure which are tasks, people, methods and environments, I would say people should be placed at the top of that list.	
             						</p>
              						<p>
							Right from week one, I had concerns about working as part of a team because of the difficulties I faced in other modules. I had previously experienced a situation where a couple of teammates dropped out thereby creating a leaner workforce. I also saw situations where people did not deliver their assigned tasks on the due date causing others to work within very tight deadlines.
							Although I benefited from diversity of ideas, the negatives of working in a group have far outweighed the positives for me because of my experience with people. Unfortunately my concerns began to manifest in the third week. There was little participation from one half of my team that I felt frustrated at times. Whilst I understand that these challenges occur in actual projects, there are usually consequences for a team member being absent or not meeting up with their deliverables. I think that there should be some consequences also in a study environment beyond the peer review system to emphasise the criticality of the “people” factor in project management.
               						</p>
              						<p>
							On a positive note, I believe my concerns spurred me to quickly address communication issues, which according to Verner et al, (2014) is one of the main risks associated with software development. As Verner et al (2014) also noted, having stakeholders located in different time zones can be problematic so I took the initiative to set up a discord channel which allowed direct communication amongst team members irrespective of our time zones. 
							I also set up a communication channel  with our clients, Group 2 and acted as the communications representative for my team. I facilitated requirements gathering meetings, drafted meeting notes and provided updates to both parties. I enjoyed taking on this role not only because it addressed a major risk but also because it helped me build a good working relationship with active course participants.
							</p>
							<p>      
							With respect to the concepts taught in the SEPM module, I found the topics software quality and behaviour-driven development most enthralling. 
							Firstly, It was insightful to learn from the Software Development Life Cycles lecturecast that some of the mistakes mentioned by Ghazi et al (1999) (such as unsystematic or insufficient testing, missing requirements and quality features) are still being made in recent times. A typical example is the Ariane 5 project which failed due to requirements and testing shortfalls. 
							This discovery further deepened my appreciation of the importance of sufficiently capturing user stories and testing them before progressing to implementation. Secondly, the formative tasks were beneficial towards my development. Testing gherkin scripts with the Python behave engine, practising the codio exercises on pytest and linters helped me to learn new python packages. 
							The group project also provided an opportunity to learn how to use github actions for automated testing. Collectively, these activities fulfilled my personal goal of improving my Python skills. 
							</p>
              						<p>
							On the flip side, I do not think this module provided a holistic experience of a typical requirements gathering exercise. Larson & Larson (2015) noted that requirements gathering is known to be one of the most difficult phases of project management as identifying a customer’s true needs can be difficult. However, In all our engagements with Group 2 at the requirements gathering phase, there were no significant challenges to note and as such the experience did not feel real.  
							I believe the major factor at play here is having teams play a dual role of customer and developer. This structure created a situation where a customer team simply agreed to what the developer team set out to do so that the same gesture could be reciprocated when the roles are flipped. 
							That, in my opinion, did not  closely portray a real life project management situation or attract genuine participation from students.
               						</p>
              						<p>
							I also wish to express my disappointment in the fact that this module did not really focus on helping students develop their skills as a project manager.  Knowing that “the single most significant factor affecting the success of a project is the leadership ability of the project manager “ - (Zulch, 2014),  I was disappointed when a number of individuals in my team did not take on that role when it was their turn. 
							Considering the criticality of a PM’s role, I suggest that future cohorts of this module incorporate a project manager’s report sheet which should be submitted by every course participant as part of the graded assessments. I believe it will be beneficial for course participants to report  what they did as a project manager and how they handled difficulties.
             						</p>
            						<p> 
							Lastly, with respect to the general PM concepts I mentioned earlier, I must mention that the topic I enjoyed the most is Estimation, Planning and Risk. Though we were not able to apply any of the risk management frameworks (OCTAVE, openFAIR and NIST) in our group project, we gained valuable knowledge from the estimation and planning aspects. I was pleased to learn about SEPM-specific estimation methods like the COCOMO and Expert Judgment. In fact, I would say my most memorable aspect of the module was when I wrote an expert judgement calculator in Python. I am grateful to have handled the estimation and planning tasks for our group project as it helped me discover a new area of interest in Project Management. 
							I am confident that I can make valuable contributions if I were to work in a planning role and I will be exploring available opportunities within my organisation.
