							<p>Looking back to the 10th of August when we commenced the Secure Software Development module, I was very enthusiastic about certain 
							aspects of the course. Mainly, the software development aspect which was really needed to improve my coding skills and the team projects
							which I believed will provide an opportunity to get to know my course mates better.  At this juncture, I would say I am happy with how 
							both have turned out (albeit not in the manner I expected) and the whole learning experience has been a fruitful one.</p> 						
							<p>To begin with, the topic of security in software development presented a whole new area of discovery. Putting things into perspective,
							my assumption was “to secure your software, just implement strong passwords, like the chrome browser suggests when creating a user account”.
							At least that was where I assumed the discussion would start from but to my amazement, an entirely strange topic, the OWASP top 10 coding
							weaknesses was introduced and I began to learn about security concepts beyond strong passwords.</p>
              						<p>We started by creating discussion posts on the “OWASP top 10 coding weaknesses” and I felt this was a good way to introduce students 
							into main issues plaguing software developers in this field. I also think other discussion topics such as “Managing Human Risk in Cybersecurity”
							and “TrueCrypt Encryption Software” were well chosen as they sparked good engagement from everyone on the course. The “Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate” 
							discussion raised some key questions in my mind about users’ priority when choosing operating systems. Ultimately, all these activities helped
							me to conduct extensive research that broadened my view of what I originally thought the module was about. They also helped to improve my
							research, analytical and critical thinking abilities. The positive feedback received from my tutor on the cybersecurity post shows how far
							I am come in research since I started the M.Sc. Computer Science program. At the moment, I am now considering writing an academic paper with my teammates.
             						</p>
             						 <p>The formative tasks which covered the areas of programming language concepts, code quality, testing are the real eye openers for me in this course.
							Prior to this program, I did not use code editors like Pycharm or VSCode therefore I never got an appreciation of linters, I also did not realise that
							a security measure could lead to a security problem (talking about “Regex” and “Evil Regex”) but I enjoyed all the coding exercises. The idea of 
							implementing security from the start of a project became solidified with these formative tasks. I am confident that in future, I can look out for security
							loopholes in codes written by skilled programmers or in methodologies used.
               						</p>
              						<p> With respect to the group assignments, I was enthralled about working in a group from the onset and even though certain aspects did not go as planned,
							it turned out to be a positive experience overall. Working in a group gave me the opportunity to demonstrate leadership skills, an example of this was when
							I took the initiative to make a presentation of our project goals and decisions prior to our code demonstration. I wanted to show the tutor our organizational
							skills as a team and I’m glad the presentation was well received.</p>
              						<p>The best aspect of the group projects still remains the synergy amongst us. My teammates are the easiest people to deal with, we developed a good rapport,
							shared experiences outside of our studies and always found a common ground on our tasks. This made the whole learning experience enjoyable for me and less 
							stressful since I was taking double modules.  In future teams, I would ensure that from the first meeting, I create a friendly atmosphere and find a way to 
							connect with everyone on the as everything else would work smoothly when there is good rapport. 
               						</p>
               						<p>“Rapport creates team unity which is the cornerstone for effective team performance” (Zander, 1975 as cited in Tomasi et al., 2015)
             						</p>
            						<p>On the other hand, I don’t think the team projects helped me to unlock my coding potentials as much as I hoped for. The first part of the group project is
							a design proposal which is something I am very comfortable with from my previous work experience. For the design proposal, I developed the introduction and
							challenges section, designed the use case diagram, and outlined the ethical considerations for our project. There were a few conflicting opinions on sections to
							include and document styling (font size, spacing) but in the end, we found a common ground and completed the job to our desired quality. For the second part,
							which is the development stage, we were required to create a secure API with CRUD functionalities. Having a skilled web developer on the team who was very thrilled
							about the project was an advantage but I think it also created a situation where the rest of us relied on him. Also, given that I had just started learning about 
							web frameworks, I could not complete certain tasks at the needed pace. To save time, we reassigned tasks and I ended up testing functionality of codes and writing 
							some of the documentation. In the end, I discovered some areas of improvements, learnt new tools, and made significant contributions.</p>
							
							<p>Ultimately, the team projects gave me an appreciation of how teams are set up in a work environment. How success is achieved when the right people do the job
							but also how important the low-weighted tasks are to the success of a project. I think additional time commitment to self-development would be a good way to
							prepare for specific roles in an upcoming project. According to Kelbaugh & Earnest (2008), a key indicator for team success is when team members engage 
							in ongoing learning opportunities to enhance their knowledge of the job area. Next time, I would attend extra training classes to help brush up my skills
							in areas that I would like to contribute towards. </p>
							
							<p>In conclusion, the Secure Software Development module was an intellectually stimulating one and it satisfied all the learning outcomes particularly in analyzing
							security risks and being an effective team member.  This module has challenged me to take a long list of developmental courses (some of which are Django and flask API,
							writing shell programs and project management). My tutor and my teammates are the most dedicated people I have worked with in an academic environment and I feel thankful
							for the whole experience. I am moving on to other courses with a higher level of confidence as a computer scientist.</p>
