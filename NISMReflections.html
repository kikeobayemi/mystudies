							<p>When we started the Network and Information Security Management Module, I was thrilled about the group projects because of the opportunity to work 
								closely and share ideas with other course participants but it gradually became less exciting and somewhat stressful as the weeks went by. We were
								originally drafted into a team of four and by the second week, one team member had dropped out of the module while another became mostly unavailable
								leaving just two of us to do all the assignments. On the positive side, there weren’t any conflicts to resolve, and I had more influence and control
								on the final assessment documents produced. As I sit back and write this reflection, I can see how this experience has shaped my mindset about taking
								on bigger responsibilities.  I have learnt that even though a project could have manpower constraints, success is still achievable through resilience,
								hard work and dedication. If faced with the same situation in future, I'll effectively utilise the opportunity to show my afore-mentioned strengths.						
							</p>
              						<p>The most enjoyable aspect of the module for me was the formative tasks. Firstly, I feel they were well distributed throughout the weeks and not overwhelming
								as I've experienced in some other modules. They also enhanced my organisational and time management skills particularly because they were well structured
								and prepared us for the final summative assessment. To elaborate, the activities from the week three and seven scanning exercise, week six pentest tools
								evaluation, and week eight security standards review were all essential for the development of the final executive report. Ultimately half of the project
								had been done with those activities completed. 
             						</p>
              						<p>Additionally, the network troubleshooting and scanning exercises helped to develop my technical and problem-solving skills. I learnt a wider application of basic
								network troubleshooting commands (ping, nslookup, dig, traceroute). On the other hand, I do not think the AWS site which was used for this activity was the
								best option. We were unable to get detailed information out of it during the week three network troubleshooting activity. For example, there were no active 
								MX records as there are no emails configured on the domain. To get a better experience of the formative task, we scanned other sites like “yahoo.com” and “google.com”
								which returned more results than the AWS. With that being said, I was able to appreciate that websites or network systems have different configurations. 
								As a Network or System administrator, it is essential to understand how a system is configured in order to effectively solve problems (Sloan, 2021).
               						</p>
              						<p>The summative assessments in this module have helped to improve my technical knowledge and project management abilities. I had previously worked in a role where
								I coordinated several Request for Proposal (RFP) processes, but I never had a chance to work on a technical proposal until this time.  I had to read extensively
								on the Penetration Testing Executive Standard (PTES) Methodology and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). I also reviewed many sample
								penetration test proposals and shared with my teammate to foster development of ideas.</p>
							<p>     My team equally benefited from utilizing project management concepts
								suggested by the module tutor. For example, the Gantt chart for indicating project timelines improved our time management and encouraged me to explore other
								tools and techniques that might improve the overall quality of a project. Patanakul et al. (2010) states that project success can be positively impacted with
								the use of project management tools such as Pareto diagram for quality management, responsibly matrix for human resource management, information retrieval systems
								for communication management and much more. Even though some of these were not applied during this module, they can be useful in my job role, and I will be
								exploring them through training courses. </p>
              						<p>Furthermore, the summative assessment provided an opportunity to work with a range of advanced resources. Using penetration testing tools (such as Kali Linux, 
								Metasploit framework, OWASP ZAP and Nmap) and applying vulnerability assessment concepts such as STRIDE and DREAD provided a great learning experience although
								it would have been preferable if the AWS website had more functionalities. I think that will be more beneficial for the student’s learning particularly with respect
								to finding a wider range of vulnerabilities.  For example, having a properly configured database would encourage learning tools like “SQLmap” to check for SQL
								injection weakness. Nevertheless, I have developed a plan to integrate some functionalities to my personal business website and then launch attacks thereafter.
								I believe this would give me an opportunity to tackle more vulnerabilities.
               						</p>
              						 <p>I found the collaborative discussion topics on data breach incidents quite interesting; It is worrisome to see the number of cases being investigated by the Data Protection
								 Commission on charges of personal data breach but at the same time, it also gives me a sense of purpose as an IT professional. There is a lot of awareness to be made
								 and clearly some knowledge gaps to be filled and I am committed to closing those gaps within my family and work circles. I did not think the discussion topics helped
								 me to conduct deep research skills as I had hoped for because I found them a bit repetitive. More so, they did not spark much engagement from the course participants,
								 so I did not feel like I gained much knowledge through them. 
             						</p>
            						<p>In conclusion, the journey through the Network and Information Security module has been a productive one. Though it came with its challenges, I feel thankful for the whole
								experience. It revealed some strengths I didn’t know I had and most importantly gave me a future development plan. </p>
