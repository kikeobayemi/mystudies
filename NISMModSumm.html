									<h3><u>Reflection</u></h3>
									<p>I have been looking forward to an opportunity that fosters collaboration between course mates and this Module has 
									  finally presented it through team projects. Though I understand the collaborative discussion forums are intended to encourage 
									   some form of engagements between students but I am hoping to get more connections and learn from people’s experiences through the team projects.
									</p>
									<p>
									   To kickstart the week, I was drafted into Group B for the module projects which will be submitted in Week 6 and 11 respectively and 
									    the first task was to create a team contract for the group. We had a meeting and got this item ticked off without hassles. I understand 
									    working in a group comes with challenges and perhaps it might be too early to conclude but so far it has been a positive experience: my team mates
									    have a wide range of IT skills and everyone communicates effectively.
									</p>
									<p>
									  The formative activity for the week was to create a collaborative discussion post on vulnerabilities and threats in the healthcare industry using the 
									  case study investigated in Glisson, W., Andel, T., McDonald, T., Jacobs, M., Campbell, M. & Mayr, J. (2015) Compromising a Medical Mannequin. 
									  Healthcare Information Systems and Technology (Sighealth). This research taught me about the cybersecurity risks that technology, particularly 
									  interconnectivity of devices brings to the healthcare industry, ways to exploit these threats and how to mitigate them. The learning points here for 
									  me is that there are cybersecurity threats everywhere technology exists regardless of the type of business. Cybersecurity should therefore be embedded 
									  into a company’s planning and budgetary expenses from the onset and into its daily operations (Bhuyan et al., 2020).

						Having studied the iStan Medical Mannequin scenario that was discussed in Week 1 and going through my course mates’ posts, 
						I made some contributions on possible technical controls that can implemented to minimise the associated cybersecurity risks.
						</p>
						We also had a team activity this week in which we used the STRIDE and DREAD tools to analyse the risk of the iStan Medical Mannequin scenario. 
						It was our first major task as a team and the reading material <b> Meier, J., Mackman, A., Dunner, M., Vasireddy, S., Escamilla, R. & Murukan, A. (2003) 
						Threat Modelling </b> was very helpful in carrying out this activity. Not only did this task improve my knowledge of threat modelling in networks security,
						it also helped me to discover the strengths of my team mates and areas for improvement. As the team leader, I can now play to the strengths of my team mates
						and assign tasks with assurance that they will be delivered to high standards.</p>
						<p>
						We had a little setback  when configuring the AWS console, one of the tools to be used for the upcoming projects. One question I asked at this point
						is “why a blank AWS site”? I think a training website with great functionalities would spark more engagements and be more beneficial for the student’s learning.
						Towards the end of the week, we managed to successfully configure the AWS console after browsing through online forums; it turned out our database settings were 
						outdated. We made the corrections and now we are set to commence our group projects.

						We carried out a team activity which involved scanning Team A’s AWS website to compile some basic network information 
						that could help in troubleshooting network problems. This was an interesting practical activity, one that I particularly looked forward to
						as it was my first time working with scanning tools. The reading material a2hosting (n.d) How to troubleshoot network connectivity using ping
						and traceroute was of tremendous help as it introduced us to the Kali linux tools such as ping, nslookup and traceroute and the syntax for 
						executing on both PCs and Macs. I do not think the AWS website was the best option for this task as it didn’t reveal information on some 
						of the questions asked such as MX records.
						
						</p>
						<p>
						In a bid to get a whole practical experience, I had to work with some other active sites such as yahoo.com. However, I must mention that the AWS
						test website gave me an appreciation of the fact that several networks or sites have different configurations. As a network or systems administrator,
						you need to first understand how a system is configured in order to change or correct misconfigurations (Sloan, 2001).
						</p>
						<p>
						Later in the week, I created a summary post that brings together all activities and learnings in the first three weeks of the module. I also arranged
						a team meeting to deliberate on Unit 6 and 11 project implementations.

						Seminar 2 took place this week and I made a presentation on our results from the team 3 scanning activities. The scan results were 
						also shared on the Collaborative Discussion 2 forum.
						</p>
						<p>
						The feedback from the tutor was encouraging and it also provided insights on how to tackle the week 6 and 11 projects. 
						The tutor advised exploring beyond the basic network commands and looking into more advanced penetration testing tools. 
						I plan to spend the next couple of days reading about popular tools such as Kali Linux. 			 
						</p>
						<p>
						TCP/IP vs ISO/OSI discussion
						The Week 3 lecture cast titled Network Fundamentals gave a good insight into the TCP/IP protocols and the OSI layers. 
						To answer the question: “Would the Internet we have today be much better if it was based on the ISO/ OSI 7-layer model rather than TCP/IP?” 
						</p>
						<p>
						I would say No for the following reasons:
						Although both models have their advantages and disadvantages, the TCP/IP model, through a 3-way handshake mechanism ensures reliable
						and secure connection for data transmission in a connection-oriented network (afteracademy, 2020). The OSI model on the other hand 
						has no special way to ensure this secure and reliable connection.TCP/IP model is older than the OSI and is well established throughout
						the world (Frenzel,2013).
						</p>

						My main focus for this week was researching on Penetration testing methodologies in preparation for 
						week 6 assignment: Pen test proposal.  I also looked at a few sample proposals done by some cybersecurity companies. 
						I took note of tools that were commonly mentioned across these proposals and conducted further research on their applications. 
						They include Wireshark, Nessus, Nmap, Kali Linux, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP and Metasploit.
						</p>
						<p>
						Although, my research this week gave me a clear direction on what is needed for the module assignments, my team mates also had to
						conduct their independent research given that it is a team assignment. More so, bringing ideas together helps to foster inclusion
						and knowledge development (Proofhub, 2018)			 
						</p>
						<p>
						The lecturecast on “Network Tools and Components” was a good refresher of my previous knowledge on various network tools and components
						and their uses. In addition, I learnt about the security risks that are applicable to them. It was very insightful to learn about the 
						security risks I might be facing in my small home network. Previously my focus has been on getting a fast and reliable internet 
						connection and not paying much attention to security. Over the next couple of weeks, I will be exploring ways to strengthen my home network.

						This week I worked with my team mates to analyse some common penetration testing tools as outlined in the article. 
						The task involved some research and helped us to solidify our final choice of tools for the upcoming pen test project.
						</p>
						<p>
						The third seminar took place this week. My team made a presentation on the tool analysis and the tutor also gave some 
						helpful tips for writing the pen test proposal. Considering that the seminar was very close to the submission deadline,
						I did not have time to conduct proper research on “Cyber Kill chain” resource provided by the tutor but it was still 
						good a knowledge to have for future work.
							 
						</p>
						<p>
						As the team leader, I spent most of my study time this week compiling the proposal report and finally made a submission 
						on behalf of the team. I found this assignment very beneficial as it goes beyond studying for a master’s degree. 
						Working in a team, conducting research on tools, writing a proposal and usage of project management concepts 
						(for example Gantt Chart for project timelines) provides experience of assignments that would be undertaken in a professional environment.
