							<h2>Computing as a Profession – Responsibilities and Challenges</h2>
							<p> The module commenced with a discussion of our responsibilities as computing professionals,the importance
							    of handling data in accordance with applicable data policies and laws in our country of operation. </p>
							<p> The class started a discussion on the European Union General Data Protection Rule (EU GDPR) this week and 
							    I wrote about the data policy in my workplace and how it is influenced by the GDPR. In particular, it was 
							    interesting to learn that organisations operating outside the EU have to comply with the GDPR as long as 
							    they are handling data of Europeans. Also insightful was the fact that a lot of countries’ data privacy 
							    laws have now been updated using the comprehensive EU GDPR as a guideline.</p>
							<p> Later this week, I started learning HTML and how to use github in order to develop my e-portfolio for the 
							    M.SC program. I found this task quite simple and interesting. My e-portfolio design also got some positive 
							    feedback from my course mates.</p>
