							<h2>Computing as a Profession – Responsibilities and Challenges</h2>
							<p> The module commenced with a discussion of our responsibilities as computing professionals,the importance
							    of handling data in accordance with applicable data policies and laws in our country of operation. </p>
							
							<p> The class started a discussion on the European Union General Data Protection Rule (EU GDPR) this week and 
							    I wrote about the data policy in my workplace and how it is influenced by the GDPR. In particular, it was 
							    interesting to learn that organisations operating outside the EU have to comply with the GDPR as long as 
							    they are handling data of Europeans. Also insightful was the fact that a lot of countries’ data privacy 
							    laws have now been updated using the comprehensive EU GDPR as a guideline.</p>
							
							<p> Later this week, I started learning HTML and how to use github in order to develop my e-portfolio for the 
							    M.SC program. I found this task quite simple and interesting. My e-portfolio design also got some positive 
							    feedback from my course mates.</p>

							<h2>Introduction to Computer Architecture and the Functionality</h2>
							<p> This week I learnt about the history of computers and how they have evolved over time. I attempted the 
							    preparation questions for seminar 1 titled “Introduction and Review of the Computer Architecture” which
							    further solidified the learnings on functionalities of a computer.</p>
							
							<p> The class also continued the discussion on data protection. I read my course mates posts and made a few 
							    contributions. I also got a few comments on mine. I found this activity very valuable as it helped me to know
							    my course mates and learn from them through the sharing of resources.</p>

							<h2>Emerging trends in Computer Science</h2>
							<p> Made another post on the EU GDPR, this time a summary of the initial post, and the subject of the last two weeks. 
							    It was mind boggling to discover the risks that emerging trends have brought to data protection especially with 
							    increased user profiles on social media platforms. On the positive side, these discoveries have instilled a new 
							    sense of discipline in me as a computing professional. Henceforth, i will pay more attention to data security and
							    increase awareness in my workplace and amongst my friends and family. </p>
							
						         <p> The formative activity for this week was to investigate some Google Artificial Intelligence tools and google tran-
							    -slation technology.</p>

								<h2>Computing Infrastructure and Network</h2>
								<p> This week, I read about computer networks and communication protocols. I answered the preparation questions for 
							   	    the second seminar titled “Computing Infrastructure and Network” which took place this week.</p>
							
							        <p> The formative activity for the week was to explore the functionalities of a web browser. I conducted my investi-
							    	    -gation on Apple Safari and I did my first assignment on Codio, which is to create a simple website. Very easy!</p>

							<h2>Software as a tool – Its functionality and Development Methodologies</h2>
							<p> Our third seminar titled “Lab Exercises on Flode” took place this week.I completed most of the flode exercises on 
							    Codio which helped me learn the correct notations used in drawing flowcharts. I found some of the exercises on strings
							    and loops a bit challenging and could not solve them correctly but in all I see how flowcharts make programming a lot
						            easier and can help explain your code to a third party.</p>

							<p> Given that the OS is the most widely used software, the formative activity for the week was to pick an operating system 
							    of choice and then conduct some investigations on its functionality. As a mac user, I choose the MacOS </p>

							<h2>Systems Software and Operating Systems</h2>
							<p> I listened to the lecture cast on Operating systems and Data Structures, where I learnt about linear and non-linear data
							    structures. I did the formative task which required more investigations to be done on the MacOS. Then, I started learning
							    python, I completed all the exercises on Codio on Basic Skills, Operators, Conditionals and Loops. The Code Visualizer feature 
							    on Codio was very helpful in line by line debugging of the code. This made my learning easier and a lot faster.</p>

							<h2>Data Abstraction</h2>
							<p> Seminar 4 titled “Data Structures” took place this week. While I was learning about Data structures, I found the concept
							    of linear data structures easier to grasp than non-linear data structures such as trees, graphs. Thankfully, I found some
							    youtube videos that simplified them further.  With the help of these youtube videos and some literature, I was able to answer 
							    seminar 4 preparation questions.</p>

							<h2>An Introduction to Algorithms and Basic Programming Concept</h2>
							<p> This week I listened to the lecture cast on Algorithms and programming where I learnt how to write a basic pseudocode and 
							    then did some more practice on python with additional exercises on Codio.</p>
							
							<p> Topics for the week are List, Strings, User-defined functions and Recursions. Of these four, I found the user-defined fun-
							    -ctions section very engaging. I enjoyed the codio examples that involved drawing patterns like the sierpinski and the tree.
							    It gave me some useful ideas for one of my personal projects.</p>
							
							<p> I submitted the module’s first graded assignment on Data Structures which covered questions on data sorting techniques, data 
							    insertion and writing pseudocodes.</p>

							<h2>Data Representation Using Database Concepts</h2>
							<p> I completed my python assessment this week, the second graded assessment of the module then I listened to the lecture cast on Fundamentals
							    of Database which taught me about Database concepts</p>
							    
							<p> I learnt about SQL this week using the practical examples on codio.  It was my first time writing SQL queries and I found it quite interesting
							    and easy. The codio examples are also very easy to follow. </p>

							<h2>Advanced SQL</h2>
							<p> I did the advanced SQL exercises on codio where I learnt how to apply SQL keywords such INNER JOIN, GROUP BY and HAVING. I also completed my SQL
							    assessment this week. </p>
